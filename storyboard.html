    This storyboard depicts the process of which I built my personal website. I had chosen to build my own site earlier this year to allow future employers
    and potential clients to contact me for web services and any other opportunities that would require my skills. I spent serveral hours researching
    different designs and implementations of other personal websites. I then drafted different wireframes of my own site, and built it out of different
    programming languages that I knew. Once this process was done, I pushed the site live to my domain and received different feedback and even one
    offer for a part time job for the Summer!
