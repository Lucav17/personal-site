            <h3>Lab 1 Research Questions</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>In our first lab we were asked to brainstorm questions related to disasters and then analyze our questions to discover any themes we were able to find.
              After finishing my list of questions and looking over them, a few themes came to mind. The first theme I had noticed was knowledge, I tended to ask alot of questions related facts about disasters I had believed the general public show know. Another theme that came to mind was preparedness, being prepared for these disasters. The last theme was a plan of attack, essentially if the people who were affects by the disaster had a plan established to deal with the aftermath. A majority of my questions we extremely broad, I asked questions such as "What do we need to know about disasters?", "What are the most dangerous?", and "What are we doing to prepare ourselves for disasters?". Following up on these themes, we were asked to find resources that could answer ur questions, or help us research further to finding the answers to our questions. The following information below is what I had found:</p>

              <br>
              <p>Red Cross - Red Cross has several disaster relief services and disaster assistance services. On top of this, they also provide information about different
                disasters, and how to prepare for them. you can find the site at www.redcross.org/about-us/our-work/disaster-relief</p>
              <p>Hands - Hands claims to be one of the worlds top disaster relief programs. This program is made up of volunteers who respond to such situations. On their site you can find their repsonses and programs, along with their processes and efforts helping solve different disaster relief crisis'. The site is located at 
              https://www.hands.org/</p>
              <p>Government - You can find a large amount of information through government sites that focus on disaster relief. this specific site that I had found contains
                a large amount of data on specific disasters, how to prepared, and what to do in the event of a disaster, along with different services available to people who are affected</p>
              <br>
              <br>

            <h3>Lab 2: Contextual Inquiry</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>After watching the new movie Deep Water Horizon, our group was inspired to examine a hypothetical oil spill in the Puget Sounds area. We decided that the potential cause of this event was the spill of a massive oil container into the water. This event woud be extremely harsh on the marine and wildlife in the area, along with the fishing economy. All shipping and transportation in this area would be halted, and the Seattle port would suffer during this event.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We decided to interview:</p>
            <ul style='padding-left:20px;'>
              <li>Oil spill cleanup manager</li>
              <li>Marine Biologist</li>
              <li>Shipping Manager</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Informal Questions</p>
            <ul style='padding-left:20px;'>
              <li>What kind of long-lasting effects should we expect in the affected area?</li>
              <li>What kind of immediate effects should we expect?</li>
              <li>What sort of technology is available to handle these types of disasters?</li>
              <li>What is the impact of this kind of disaster on your line of work?</li>
              <li>What sort of legislation has resulted from this disaster in the past?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Formal Questions:</p>
            <ul style='padding-left:20px;'>
              <li>What is the time frame for cleaning up an oil spill?</li>
              <li>What kind of cost would you expect to see from this disaster?</li>
              <li>What are the best methods for recovery?</li>
              <li>Who will be most impacted?</li>
              <li>What is the first step in responding to this disaster?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Survey Questions</p>
            <ul style='padding-left:20px;'>
              <li>Describe the shortcomings you experienced last time when handling this type of disaster.</li>
              <li>What is the most limiting factor in handling this kind of disaster?/li>
              <li>Rate your level of direct involvement with the clean up of the spill.</li>
              <li>What are your recommendations for approaching this disaster in the future?</li>
              <li>What are your recommendations for preventing this disaster in the future?</li>

            <h3>Lab 3: User Research</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>In todays lab we were asked to choose a topic that we know is a common issue, adn then explore that topic. We chose the issue of college kids not knowing how to cook. We chose this issue due to the fact that there could be several reasons as to why a student does know how to cook for themselves or as to why they refuse to learn. OVerall from our surveys, we learned that budget, time, and skill play a huge roll into this issue as college kids tend to not have money, are busy with school, and were never taught to cook prior to college.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Summary Of our user feedback</p>
            <p>Two of my group members were in charge of presenting our issue to other people and recording their results. We had identified that users affected by this problem either didn't have access to a kitchen, or if they did, they just didnt really use it to its full potential. Often times our surveyers ate out, or just purchased frozen food to save time, or because they just didnt have the skills to make a nice meal. However this a costly option for them, as purchasing pre made meals can get expensive.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Design Ideas</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Create an app that would show students simple one pot recipes, cooking techniques, ad cooking classes</li>
              <li>Cookbook that included one pot, four ingredient recipes, with photos and detailed instruction of every meal.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Lab 4: Storyboard and Video</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Today in class we learned about storyboarding and the process of creating videos. We watched different videos which allowed us to learn the do's and don'ts of creating videos. We were then tasked with shooting b-film of us working together to be used in our final video. At the time we didn't take footage we thought was worthy of using for the final project, however I feel that while working together during our class projects we will end up with alot of usable footage for the future.
            </p>
            <p>Our storyboard was structured in a way that it was to show a time lapse of us working together. The storyboard starts with us first meeting, then moves into us designing and doing different activities, and then finally the last story is us succeeding in the class.</p>

            <h3>Reflections</h3>
            <hr>
            <h4>Entry #1</h4>
            <p>I am excited to learn more about design. I feel like this class can help me a lot. I am excited to find out what team I get put on. I probably won't share this. I wonder how long this class has been a part of the I school. This exercise is unique, and it gets you to think more about what you've done in this class, how you feel, and what you hope to achieve. I am excited to see what other people have similar interests as me in this class. I need to focus more on what's going on. Do the readings/homework. I am out of ideas again. You learn about some pretty nifty stuff that you don’t learn about in other classes in here. That bionics think really captured my interest. I wonder how that guy started his company and what his process was like. Same with the robot company the other day. Ted talks are cool, we should watch more of them. This class had me thinking that I should start reading different news everyday to keep up with whats going in the world and what is currently trending etc</p>
            <h4>Entry #2</h4>
            <p>This class has been enjoyable in the sense that it makes you think outside the box, in different ways, and makes you use your imagination to make a goal or idea possible. We are taught to think about everything, everyone, and anything that can happen. We listen to horror stories through podcasts, example interviews etc on things we should and should not do, and what we can and cannot do. It is apparent that a lot goes into design. We've learned about the set up process of design thinking and effective ways to go about it, for example today we watched two interviews, one with Obama and one in a more professional setting. We were allowed to see the do's and don'ts of interviewing others and then we were able to reflect on it and talk about why something worked and why something did not work. Later today we are supposed to finish our homework for this class, and I can use the content I learned in the last two classes to finish my assignment and do it well. I look forward to seeing what's going to happen with this class in the future, what design tools we will learn, how to process ideas, how to create these ideas and what to look for when creating something. I plan to use this class to come with my next big project and see what I can do with it moving forward.  
</p>
            <h4>Entry #3</h4>
            <p>The idea was that each drone would be pre equipped with rations/survival materials and during a disaster they would be sent out into the affected areas. Each drone would have its own artificial intelligence to know where its gone where its going to and how its going to return. It would also have to identify who's already gotten supplies and who hasn’t. This could be problematic. If this was an issue we could assign a drone to a specific location in an area and then have them drop a case of supplies there, all drones would do this and would drop supplies all over the area however this could make people become selfish greedy or other things since we wont be regulating the people. The drones could return to base and be re stocked by a team of people and then send them out again to make it more feasible. This could be a lot more efficient way to send things out to people rather than bringing in supplies and making people wait for them. The drones could also be solar powered so people from other areas can send them long distances and can be built to travel 50 to 60 mph like racing drones this would allow other states/cities/countries to help out. There could be a need for this.
</p>
            <h4>Entry #4</h4>
            <p>Today's lesson began with failure, what does it mean to fail, how do we know we failed, and how do we accept failure. This conversation really stuck with me because I have failed in the past, whether it be school or getting a job, or just letting other people down. However because I have failed, I know how to deal with failure, I always sort the situation out to the best of my ability, make sure it is good and then move on and learn from my mistakes. We also talked about prototyping and how to prototype. For example we talked about the first iphone and what it looked like, it was hideous, but the point of prototyping is to build a functional base to improve off of section by section to perfect the product. We then talked about the different methods of prototyping, such as using paper systems or digital systems, and then we built a real prototype which was nifty. Our job was to build a prototype for currency to allow people who are blind be able to use the currency.

            <h3>Failure Reflection</h3>
            <h4>What messages do we receive that its not okay to fail?</h4>
            <p>There are several ways of people telling others that it's not okay to fail. Alot of these messages tend to be direct, as failure can be of great importance to some people and therefore make an effort to let you know that it is not okay to fail. One example of this is my parents who constantly have applied pressure on me througout my life to ensure I succeed in school. I would get rewarded with good grades, but scolded with bad grades. Similarly I can imagine this being popular in alot of other households where school is important to the childs parents. There is also internal messages such as seeing other people around you succeed and you feeling the pressure to do the same.</p>
            <h4>What is the value of failure (personally, in society, in design)? What are the risks?</h4>
            <p>Failure is extremely important. When someone fails, they are forced to reflect on what they did wrong, and they learn to problem solve and go about the issue in a way they didnt before. This is true personally, in society, and in design.<br>
              The risks of failing is that you can be affected personally by a failure, or get discourages from getting back up and trying again.</p>
              <h4>When is failure okay for you personally? At what point is failure not okay?</h4>
              <p>Personally, I try to avoid failure at all costs, especially with things that do matter to me. This is true in school, and my business ventures of owning a few companies and doing freelance work for different clients. Failure is okay to me when I fail at something irrelevant or have another shot without any risks. Failure is not okay when I am dealing with clients or working on school projects, or on something I know needs to be perfect the first time.</p>
              <h4>Whats something you procrastinate doing or don’t do at all because you’re afraid you might fail?</h4>
            <p>Right now it is currently taking my online technical tests for internships. I have one shot and they are for big companies I would love to work for. Unfortunately I am afraid of failing them so Ive put them off so I can re learn my java skills and programming skills.</p>
            <h4>If your boss or teacher told you to fail on purpose how would you do it?</h4>
            <p>If my boss or teacher told me to fail on purpose, I would ask them specifically what they wanted to hapen and why. This way if I fail, and they are the ones who are requiring it, I follow their exact guidelines.</p>
